# Historical Property Data Analysis

This Power BI project analyzes historical property data across sale prices, land use, and occupancy trends. It delivers strategic insights into market health, value compression, and urban development patterns, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on investment, planning, and policy.

# UrbanScope Property Analytics Project – Insights to Strategic Decision-Making

Executive Case Study (Multi-Year Property Trends – Gauteng)

1. Context & Objective
UrbanScope initiated a multi-year property analytics project to evaluate evolving real estate dynamics across Gauteng. This Power BI engagement was designed to:
•	Analyse sale price trends, transaction volumes, and land use shifts
•	Identify value compression, market volatility, and occupancy patterns
•	Support strategic planning, investment decisions, and urban policy formulation
The scope spans 2015–2021, integrating transactional, locational, and structural data to build a comprehensive urban property intelligence framework.

2. How the Project Was Conducted
This BI initiative followed a structured, executive-aligned methodology:
Phase	Activity	Executive Output
Data Acquisition & Validation	Consolidated multi-source property data, normalised sale prices, built time-series and categorical models	Trusted analytics foundation
Exploratory Analytics	Mapped transaction count volatility, CAGR trends, and land use evolution	Identified market inflexion
KPI Definition & DAX Modelling	Created metrics: price per bedroom/bathroom, land share %, vacant % total, volatility index	Strategic performance indicators
Dashboard Build	Four thematic report pages: Performance, Behaviour, Land Use, and Value Compression	Executive-ready insights pack
Insight Synthesis	Extracted key themes: price decline drivers, occupancy shifts, and land use concentration	Actionable strategic levers

3. Market Context (Gauteng Property Landscape)
Gauteng’s property market reflects urban densification, land use diversification, and price volatility. Key forces shaping the landscape include:
•	Shifting buyer preferences (e.g., apartments vs detached homes)
•	Government zoning and infrastructure projects
•	Vacancy rates and underutilised land segments
•	Macro-economic pressures on sale price growth
Strategic opportunities lie in land repurposing, mixed-use development, and targeted investment in high-demand corridors.

PAGE 1 — Market Performance Overview
A macro-level snapshot of property market health:
Highlights:
•	CAGR for sale price: -11.3% over the period
•	Transaction count volatility with 100% rebound in 2021
•	Sale price index and market value compression
•	Year-on-year trend analysis across property types
This page provides a baseline performance lens for evaluating market resilience and pricing dynamics.

PAGE 2 — Price & Value Distribution Analysis
Deep dive into price structures and spatial value patterns:
•	Median price per area: R493,750
•	Price per bedroom and bathroom benchmarks
•	Scatter plot of sale price distribution across categories
•	Comparative analysis across city-road combinations
This page reveals where value concentrates, how pricing scales, and which areas show pricing anomalies.

PAGE 3 — Land Use & Occupancy Shifts
Understanding how land is used and how occupancy evolves:
•	Land share % total: 29.73%, Vacant % total: 4.73%
•	Year-on-year shifts in residential typologies (e.g., apartment vs condo)
•	Pie and bar charts showing land use distribution
•	Strategic implications of vacancy and densification trends
This page informs urban planning, zoning strategy, and land optimisation.

PAGE 4 — Volatility & Value Compression
Final synthesis of volatility and value compression signals:
•	Volatility Index: 2.06%, Norm: 0.61
•	Sale price vs building area trends (2015–2019)
•	Land use category performance (e.g., greenbelt, office park)
•	Address-level insights for high-value or volatile zones
This page enables risk assessment, investment prioritisation, and policy calibration.

4. Why This Project Matters for Leadership
This Power BI project transforms raw property data into strategic intelligence:
•	Builds a repeatable framework for urban property reviews
•	Establishes key metrics for land use, pricing, and volatility
•	Equips leadership with data-backed planning tools
•	Bridges analytics into investment and development strategy

5. Next Steps (Strategic BI Enablement)
To evolve this into a full-scale urban analytics product, the roadmap includes:
1.	Integrate zoning and permit data → enable regulatory impact modelling
2.	Add geospatial overlays (GIS) → visualise land use and pricing hotspots
3.	Incorporate demographic and income data → enrich buyer segmentation
4.	Automate refresh and governance → support quarterly planning cycles
